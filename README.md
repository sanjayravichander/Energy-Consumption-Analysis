**Approach Involved:**
The approach involved a comprehensive analysis of energy usage and GHG emissions, evaluating conservation effectiveness through key criteria.
I have employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify trends, allowing for a holistic understanding of the BPS organizations' environmental impact through the Interactive Visualizations which have been created.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
The below mentioned dashboard tells about the how Green house gas affecting across all the sectors and also the distribution of Renewable resources,
which has been deployed in organizations and itâ€™s quantity and factor value.

The below mentioned dashboard tells about the consumption of different kind of materials used across the organizations,
along by showing the Operation, Operation type and in which city thorugh Geographical Map.

**Conclusion**
Through the Analysis, It identified successful conservation measures in certain BPS organizations while pinpointing areas for improvement. 
The data-driven suggestions include implementing targeted energy efficiency initiatives, investing in renewable energy sources, and fostering sustainable practices
to achieve ambitious climate change mitigation goals within the Broader Public Sector.
